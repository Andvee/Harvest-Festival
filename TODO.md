    - Generate rooms in dimensions and keep track with the mine tracker
        - Different size and shaped rooms
- Make all cooking equipment render things that they are cooking

- Add Extra Chat Messages, and Conversations for all NPCs
- New Winter Mine building that is surround by water (That turns to ice in winter)
- Redo the ASM for the crops, making them sellable
- Remove coin render overlay or move it
