 * Please upload your crash reports or logs to [gist](https://gist.github.com/) or similiar sites, don't just paste it in raw!
 * If the issue is not a crash, please provide your fml-client-latest.log or fml-server-latest.log
 * Make sure you have the latest version of Harvest Festival, since your issue might already have been fixed!
 * Preferably providing us with what Forge version you are using. Same thing applies if the issue is between Harvest Festival and another mod.
 * Please check out [Plans.md](https://github.com/PenguinSquad/Harvest-Festival/blob/1.10.2/PLANS.md), before doing any suggestions!
